Ok, the last 2 days I havent focused on the project as much.
I have been focused on real life events but I can also share that I am at a road
block in regards to the code.  
I dont feel expressive enough to be able to fogure out how to write it
independantly.  

Maybe Ill try break it down into steps and what needs to still be addressed.

- [ ] connecting body to head
- [ ] free.queue on apple when on collision with snake head
- [ ] if delete, append body to snake

Ok, I think it may be within reach for me to get the apple to free.queue() if
the snake head touches it. I think I can do that with a custom signal
Lets go read some documentation

Cool, the snake now eats the apples and they dissapear!
Pretty simple actually
