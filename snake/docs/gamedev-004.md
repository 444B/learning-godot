Ok, I am halfway through the gamedev challenge
It has been far more of a challenge then I realised to write every day and to
make time. I have had some real world matters that required my attention but I
am proud to say that I still managed to do at least one thing every day.

Today I got the snake to have a body variable and to incrememnt it upon eating
an apple

tomorrow I just need to handle the body pathing and incrementing the bodies.

I have turned to gipppity as an instructor in the end owing to not being able
to find the answers in the docs or forums.
I will ask online in discord but I think It is Ok to use gipppity to learn (and)
not to parrot out code that is not my own
