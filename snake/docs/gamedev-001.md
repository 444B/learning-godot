Ok, a new day a new fresh start.
I have spent my morning specifically on non-computing things, to develop other
skills and since my computer time has been many hours each day. I want to make
sure I am balancing out my skills development and also giving my eyes a break.  

So now, on to gdscript day.  
The vast majority of today will be spent on gdscript.
Its also the most challenging aspect and likely why I have been delaying it as
well.  
For now, I will review all my notes from yesterday.

In terms of the suggested workflow, I actually seem to be doing rather well!
- [X] Understand what goes into game design:
- [X] Create assets
- [X] import to Godot
- [ ] code it all into place

Here is the TODO list for that last item, taken directly from my list of things 
to focus on today:
- Getting my hands dirty with GDscript.
- Getting movement of snake head
- connecting body to head
- free.queue on apple when on collision with snake head
- if delete, append body to snake

Lets get started!

Ok, I have made some progress!
My snake head can now detect touching either its own body or the apple
It will also increment the number of apples eaten
