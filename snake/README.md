# Snake

## Background
In the last few months, I have worked on a few projects that I am proud of.  
I have learned a fortune and it has enhanced by skillset and self confidence.  

In the last week or so, I have become infatuated with [Godot](https://godotengine.org/)  
As the 5th largest project on github by number of contributors, this stands out in the open source ecosystem.  


## The Goal
I will merge these two branches of thought and my goal is to make a game with Godot in one weeks time.  
That is before 2024-03-30 16:00:00 +0000 which is in **exactly** 7 days, or 168 hours from now.  

## The minimum requirements:  
- It has to be recognisable as a game.  
- It has to have its source code published [here](https://github.com/444B/learning-godot/tree/main/snake)  
- It has to be published to [itch.io](https://444b.itch.io/)  
- I have to document my progress and create a post here every single day (gamedev-001 --> gamedev-007)  
- I have to work on this no matter how I feel or what other burden I may be carrying. I will get it done.  

I am opting for the simplest game that I can (snake) since I know myself and I will need to keep the scope as limited as possible to avoid becoming overwhelmed when learning something new.  

I will also attempt to use only the community and official docs for this.  
No GPT generated code or assistance.  

Wish me luck!
